    "    - For our home page we can make it so that there are different levels (Beginner to Advanced) for users to click on as they advance in their knowledge in biotechnology on our websites. This create a chronological order of events that will make our website more organized and easy to follow for a first-time user\n",

    "    - We could also add a page dedicated to information, notes, or lessons about biotechnology so that the user can gain some knowledge before jumping straight into our games\n",
    "- We may also need to consider reformatting our header and home page in general to make it more visiually engaging\n"
