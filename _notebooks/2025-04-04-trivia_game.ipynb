    "    - Selects difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).\n",
    "2. Question Display\n",
    "    - A question with multiple-choice options is fetched from your database.\n",
    "3. User Selection\n",
    "    - User selects an answer.\n",
    "    - Instant feedback (correct or incorrect) is displayed.\n",
    "4. Score Update\n",
    "    - The score is updated dynamically based on the user's selection.\n",
    "5. End of Game\n",
    "    - After a set number of questions, the game ends.\n",
    "    - Final score is displayed.\n",
    "6. Leaderboard\n",
